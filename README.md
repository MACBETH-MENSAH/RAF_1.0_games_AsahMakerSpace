# RAF 1.0 Games

A collection of **ten educational games** developed for the **RAF 1.0 robot** during an internship at **Asah Makerspace**. These games leverage the robot’s **line-following** and **obstacle avoidance** capabilities to teach students programming, robotics, and problem-solving in an interactive way.

**Developed by:** Dev Macbeth McKingsson

## Games Included
1. D-Tor Dash  
2. Matador Run  
3. Sniffy  
4. LoopHero  
5. Bound Rush  
6. Crossroad Quest  
7. Parking Bay  
8. Mirror Escape  
9. ParkkingBay  
10. Mirror Escape (refined)

## Purpose
These games aim to provide hands-on learning for students by introducing:
- Basic robotics concepts  
- Sensor integration (IR and ultrasonic)  
- Motor control and robot movement  
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving

## Technologies
- **Arduino IDE** – Game algorithm development and testing  
- **PictoBlox** – Graphical programming for educational demos  
- **RAF 1.0 hardware** – DC motors, IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, microcontrollers

## Usage
1. Open the Arduino code in the respective folder for each game.  
2. Upload the code to the RAF 1.0 robot.  
3. Run the robot and observe its line-following and obstacle avoidance behavior.  

## Progress
Some games are fully functional while others (e.g., D-Tor Dash) are still being optimized for return-to-line logic and obstacle range adjustments.
